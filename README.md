# Quizzer

## Project Description

Quizzer is a web-based platform designed for teachers and students at Haaga Helia to enhance learning through interactive quizzes. Teachers can create, manage, and categorize quizzes with multiple-choice questions on course-related topics, while students can take these quizzes to test and improve their knowledge. The application includes two main dashboards: a Teacher Dashboard, where teachers add and organize quizzes by categories like "Vocabulary" or "Geography" and manage questions and answers, and a Student Dashboard, where students can access published quizzes, receive instant feedback on their answers, view results, and share their thoughts through reviews. Quizzer aims to make learning engaging and accessible for both teachers and students.
